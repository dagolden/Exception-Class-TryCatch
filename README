NAME
    Exception::Class::TryCatch - Syntactic try/catch sugar for use with
    Exception::Class

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 1.12.

SYNOPSIS
         use Exception::Class::TryCatch;
     
     # simple usage of catch()
     
     eval { Exception::Class::Base->throw('error') };
         catch my $err and warn $err->error;
     
     # catching only certain types or else rethrowing
     
     eval { Exception::Class::Base::SubClass->throw('error') };
         catch( my $err, ['Exception::Class::Base', 'Other::Exception'] )
             and warn $err->error; 
     
     # catching and handling different types of errors
     
     eval { Exception::Class::Base->throw('error') };
         if ( catch my $err ) {
             $err->isa('this') and do { handle_this($err) };
             $err->isa('that') and do { handle_that($err) };
         }
     
     # use "try eval" to push exceptions onto a stack to catch later
     
     try eval { 
             Exception::Class::Base->throw('error') 
         };
         do {
             # cleanup that might use "try/catch" again
         };
         catch my $err; # catches a matching "try"

DESCRIPTION
    Exception::Class::TryCatch provides syntactic sugar for use with
    Exception::Class using the familiar keywords "try" and "catch". Its
    primary objective is to allow users to avoid dealing directly with $@ by
    ensuring that any exceptions caught in an "eval" are captured as
    Exception::Class objects, whether they were thrown objects to begin with
    or whether the error resulted from "die". This means that users may
    immediately use "isa" and various Exception::Class methods to process
    the exception.

    In addition, this module provides for a method to push errors onto a
    hidden error stack immediately after an "eval" so that cleanup code or
    other error handling may also call "eval" without the original error in
    $@ being lost.

    Inspiration for this module is due in part to Dave Rolsky's article
    "Exception Handling in Perl With Exception::Class" in *The Perl Journal*
    (Rolsky 2004).

    The "try/catch" syntax used in this module does not use code reference
    prototypes the way the Error.pm module does, but simply provides some
    helpful functionality when used in combination with "eval". As a result,
    it avoids the complexity and dangers involving nested closures and
    memory leaks inherent in Error.pm (Perrin 2003).

    Rolsky (2004) notes that these memory leaks may not occur in recent
    versions of Perl, but the approach used in Exception::Class::TryCatch
    should be safe for all versions of Perl as it leaves all code execution
    to the "eval" in the current scope, avoiding closures altogether.

USAGE
  "catch"
         # zero argument form
         my $err = catch;
     
     # one argument forms
         catch my $err;
         my $err = catch( [ 'Exception::Type', 'Exception::Other::Type' ] );
     
     # two argument form
         catch my $err, [ 'Exception::Type', 'Exception::Other::Type' ];

    Returns an "Exception::Class::Base" object (or an object which is a
    subclass of it) if an exception has been caught by "eval" or else
    returns "undef" if no error exists. The exception is either popped from
    a hidden error stack (see "try") or, if the stack is empty, taken from
    the current value of $@.

    If the exception is not an "Exception::Class::Base" object (or subclass
    object), an "Exception::Class::Base" object will be created using the
    string contents of the exception. This means that calls to "die" will be
    wrapped and may be treated as exception objects. Other objects caught
    will be stringfied and wrapped likewise. Such wrapping will likely
    result in confusing stack traces and the like, so any methods other than
    "error" used on "Exception::Class::Base" objects caught should be used
    with caution.

    "catch" is prototyped to take up to two optional scalar arguments. The
    single argument form has two variations.

    *   If the argument is a reference to an array, any exception caught
        that is not of the same type (or a subtype) of one of the classes
        listed in the array will be rethrown.

    *   If the argument is not a reference to an array, "catch" will set the
        argument to the same value that is returned. This allows for the
        "catch my $err" idiom without parentheses.

    In the two-argument form, the first argument is set to the same value as
    is returned. The second argument must be an array reference and is
    handled the same as as for the single argument version with an array
    reference, as given above.

  "caught" (DEPRECATED)
    "caught" is a synonym for "catch" for syntactic convenience.

    NOTE: Exception::Class version 1.21 added a "caught" method of its own.
    It provides somewhat similar functionality to this subroutine, but with
    very different semantics. As this class is intended to work closely with
    Exception::Class, the existence of a subroutine and a method with the
    same name is liable to cause confusion and this method is deprecated and
    may be removed in future releases of Exception::Class::TryCatch.

    This method is no longer exported by default.

  "try"
         # void context
         try eval {
           # dangerous code
         };
         do {
           # cleanup code can use try/catch
         };
         catch my $err;
     
     # scalar context
         $rv = try eval { return $scalar };
     
     # list context
         @rv = try [ eval { return @array } ];

    Pushes the current error ($@) onto a hidden error stack for later use by
    "catch". "try" uses a prototype that expects a single scalar so that it
    can be used with eval without parentheses. As "eval { BLOCK }" is an
    argument to try, it will be evaluated just prior to "try", ensuring that
    "try" captures the correct error status. "try" does not itself handle
    any errors -- it merely records the results of "eval". "try { BLOCK }"
    will be interpreted as passing a hash reference and will (probably) not
    compile. (And if it does, it will result in very unexpected behavior.)

    Since "try" requires a single argument, "eval" will normally be called
    in scalar context. To use "eval" in list context with "try", put the
    call to "eval" in an anonymous array:

       @rv = try [ eval {return @array} ];

    When "try" is called in list context, if the argument to "try" is an
    array reference, "try" will dereference the array and return the
    resulting list.

    In scalar context, "try" passes through the scalar value returned by
    "eval" without modifications -- even if that is an array reference.

       $rv = try eval { return $scalar };
       $rv = try eval { return [ qw( anonymous array ) ] };

    Of course, if the eval throws an exception, "eval" and thus "try" will
    return undef.

    "try" must always be properly bracketed with a matching "catch" or
    unexpected behavior may result when "catch" pops the error off of the
    stack. "try" executes right after its "eval", so inconsistent usage of
    "try" like the following will work as expected:

         try eval {
             eval { die "inner" };
             catch my $inner_err
             die "outer" if $inner_err;
         };
         catch my $outer_err;
         # handle $outer_err;

    However, the following code is a problem:

         # BAD EXAMPLE
         try eval {
             try eval { die "inner" };
             die $@ if $@;
         };
         catch my $outer_err;
         # handle $outer_err;

    This code will appear to run correctly, but "catch" gets the exception
    from the inner "try", not the outer one, and there will still be an
    exception on the error stack which will be caught by the next "catch" in
    the program, causing unexpected (and likely hard to track) behavior.

    In short, if you use "try", you must have a matching "catch". The
    problem code above should be rewritten as:

         try eval {
             try eval { die "inner" };
             catch my $inner_err;
             $inner_err->rethrow if $inner_err;
         };
         catch my $outer_err;
         # handle $outer_err;
